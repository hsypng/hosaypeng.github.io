Commit and push changes to GitHub.

1. Run `git status` to see changes
2. Run `git diff` to understand what changed
3. Stage the relevant files (prefer specific files over `git add .`)
4. Create a commit with a concise message focused on "why" not "what"
5. Push to the remote branch
6. Verify the push succeeded
